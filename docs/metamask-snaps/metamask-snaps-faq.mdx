MetaMask Snaps brings a whole new dimension of possibilities to your MetaMask experience. Are you new to MetaMask Snaps, or do you have questions about the Open Beta? You 're at the right place.

## MetaMask Snaps FAQs

1. **What is MetaMask Snaps?** MetaMask Snaps allows users to add features and functionality to their MetaMask wallet. Individual Snaps are features created by third-party developers that MetaMask users can install directly into their wallet.

   We believe a decentralized internet that is accessible to all and owned by the people who use it, will give rise to human flourishing on an exponential scale. Whilst our roots are in Ethereum, and our expertise is grounded in building the leading self-custodial wallet, we appreciate that innovation occurs in many domains across the web3 ecosystem. With Snaps, we hope to capture the full extent of the innovation happening in web3, by enabling developers to bring their specialist expertise to building for our platform.

2. **What is a Snap?** A Snap is an application built by a third-party developer that adds features and functionality to MetaMask. Snaps can [connect to blockchain protocols beyond Ethereum](/metamask-snaps/what-are-interoperability-snaps), show [insights about transactions](/metamask-snaps/what-are-security-snaps), display [notifications](/metamask-snaps/what-are-communication-snaps), add new privacy and identity features, and much more.
3. **Will MetaMask charge for MetaMask Snaps, or will it be free to use?** The MetaMask Snaps platform is free to use. While there is no cost to install Snaps, an individual Snap might offer services that require payment, incur fees, or contain paid subscriptions.
4. **Will new features come via MetaMask Snaps only, or will MetaMask still add features natively to the Extension and Mobile App?** MetaMask will continue to build new features in the extension, mobile apps, and [portfolio.metamask.io](http://portfolio.metamask.io/?utm_source=metamaskSupport&utm_medium=knowledge-base&utm_campaign=2023_Sep_snaps-launch_content_faq). Some new features may be built as Snaps.
5. **Will there be more Snaps available in the future? If so, what can we expect and when?** The MetaMask Snaps journey has only just begun! There are many more Snaps in development and more will be made available over time. Expect new Snaps to be added by the end of 2023 and beyond.
6. **Where can I find more information about MetaMask Snaps?** You can learn more at [metamask.io/snaps](http://metamask.io/snaps?utm_source=metamaskSupport&utm_medium=knowledge-base&utm_campaign=2023_Sep_snaps-launch_content_faq), or read our [getting started guide for MetaMask Snaps](/metamask-snaps/getting-started-with-metamask-snaps).

## MetaMask Snaps Open Beta FAQs

1. **How is the MetaMask Snaps Open Beta different to the final version of MetaMask Snaps?** The MetaMask Snaps Open Beta is different in that it will host a variety of allowlisted Snaps, which have been audited by third parties as well as the MetaMask team. MetaMask Snaps Open Beta is a first step to building this permissionless system. Ultimately, our vision of MetaMask Snaps is to be fully permissionless, without any gatekeepers.
2. **Where can I install a Snap?** During the MetaMask Snaps Open Beta phase, we recommend you install Snaps from the [MetaMask Snaps Directory](https://snaps.metamask.io/?utm_source=metamaskSupport&utm_medium=knowledge-base&utm_campaign=2023_Sep_snaps-launch_content_faq).
3. **Are there any other directories that host Snaps?** Ultimately, MetaMask users will be able to install Snaps from anywhere. During the MetaMask Snaps Open Beta phase, we recommend you install Snaps from the [MetaMask Snaps Directory](https://snaps.metamask.io/?utm_source=metamaskSupport&utm_medium=knowledge-base&utm_campaign=2023_Sep_snaps-launch_content_faq). We also gave a grant to a [third-party directory](https://snaps.directory) to support a community-built directory, more information about that [here](https://snapshot.org/#/heart.mmgdao.eth/proposal/0xd084fba8aae8c37cb9a807f66e19c3c1ce76a980a51b64656e6cd87a9a3920fe). This is in line with our vision of having a fully decentralized system where MetaMask is not a gatekeeper.
4. **How do I know I'm installing a safe Snap?** First of all, we recommend installing a snap from the [MetaMask Snaps Directory](https://snaps.metamask.io/?utm_source=metamaskSupport&utm_medium=knowledge-base&utm_campaign=2023_Sep_snaps-launch_content_faq) only as we roll out the open beta. This is your best bet in making sure you're installing a snap in an environment where the allowlisted snaps are available as we roll out the Open Beta.

   Secondly, the open beta only has allowlisted Snaps available in the directory. This means that these Snaps have been audited. Note that this doesn 't mean that these Snaps can't have bugs or vulnerabilities, only that the authors aren't actively trying to defraud you.

5. **How will MetaMask keep me safe in the future when it has become fully permissionless?** At MetaMask, keeping your wallet safe is of utmost priority. As with any other web3 interactions, we recommend you use precaution. Some tips to remember are:

   - Never click links you don 't trust.
   - Always install a Snap directly through the [MetaMask Snaps Directory](https://snaps.metamask.io/?utm_source=metamaskSupport&utm_medium=knowledge-base&utm_campaign=2023_Sep_snaps-launch_content_faq).
   - If you're unsure, stop, wait, and think before proceeding. Stop if you're unsure.
   - If you need help or are in doubt, [reach out to us](/getting-started/how-to-contact-metamask-support?utm_source=metamaskSupport&utm_medium=knowledge-base&utm_campaign=2023_Sep_snaps-launch_content_faq).

   As we roll out MetaMask Snaps to become fully permissionless, we will continue to work on ways to keep users as safe as possible.

## General FAQs

As you venture into the realm of MetaMask Snaps, you might have questions about installation, security, and impact on your MetaMask experience. Find answers to common questions and make the most of the MetaMask Snaps Open Beta.

1. **Where can I find and install available Snaps?** With the launch of the Open Beta, we recommend users to install Snaps directly from the [MetaMask Snaps Directory](https://snaps.metamask.io/?utm_source=metamaskSupport&utm_medium=knowledge-base&utm_campaign=2023_Sep_snaps-launch_content_faq). Though Snaps can be installed directly from dapps as well, we recommend users to use the directory only at this time. This may change in the future as we further roll out Snaps and make it more permissionless. Check out our guide on [Getting started with MetaMask Snaps](/metamask-snaps/getting-started-with-metamask-snaps).

2. **Can I use Snaps on both MetaMask Extension and Mobile App?** Currently, Snaps are only available in the MetaMask browser extension v11.0 and up.

3. **Where can I find installed Snaps?** Look for the three vertical dots in the upper-right corner of your MetaMask window, click on these dots to reveal a drop-down menu, and select 'settings. ' This will open a new window where you can manage your MetaMask settings. Click on 'snaps ' to access a list of all Snaps currently installed in your MetaMask instance.

4. **Are Snaps linked to all accounts in my wallet, or only for the account connected to the dapp?** Snaps are installed into the MetaMask extension. Snaps are not specific to a single account or dapp.

5. **Can Snaps collect data?** Any user data you share with a third-party developed Snap will be collected directly by the developer of that Snap; MetaMask does not have access to this data. You should read the terms of use and privacy policy of each Snap before installing.

6. **Are Snaps safe to use?** Snaps run in a sandboxed environment and use a permissions model to protect your data and respect your consent. Snaps do not have access to your MetaMask account data. When installing a Snap, make sure you understand what permissions you are granting to stay secure.

   Before proceeding to install a Snap, ensure you understand the permissions being requested and what the Snap is used for. Always remember:

   - Never click links you don 't trust.
   - Always install a Snap directly through the [MetaMask Snaps Directory](https://snaps.metamask.io/?utm_source=metamaskSupport&utm_medium=knowledge-base&utm_campaign=2023_Sep_snaps-launch_content_faq).
   - If you're unsure, stop, wait, and think before proceeding. Stop if you're unsure.

7. **Is there a limit to the number of Snaps I can use? Can multiple Snaps be installed and used simultaneously?** There is no limit, you are free to install as many Snaps as you wish. Multiple Snaps can be installed and used simultaneously. The Snaps platform is designed to support many different Snaps running simultaneously.

8. **Can Snaps cause any performance issues or system instability?** The Snaps platform enforces certain limits on individual Snaps to ensure that your system remains stable. If you see any performance issues with Snaps, please get in touch with Support via the “Start a Conversation” button on the [MetaMask help center homepage](http://support.metamask.io/hc).

9. **How can I troubleshoot issues with Snaps?** [Read our guide on troubleshooting a Snap](/metamask-snaps/how-to-troubleshoot-snap-issues).

10. **How do I uninstall or disable a Snap?** Looking to (temporarily) disable a Snap? You can easily do so by [accessing the Snap's settings](/metamask-snaps/how-to-access-snap-settings). No longer need a specific Snap? [Read our guide on uninstalling a Snap](/metamask-snaps/how-to-uninstall-a-snap).

11. **What information will the Snap developer see from my wallet?** Different types of Snaps will have access to different information based on the permissions granted at installation. Only install Snaps from developers that you trust, and always check the privacy policy of a Snap before installation.

12. **Can Snaps be used to modify the user interface or user experience of MetaMask?** Snaps can provide custom user interfaces in dialogs and in the transaction confirmation flow.

13. **Can Snaps access and modify the MetaMask Extension's data or settings? What are the limitations of this kind of access?** Snaps are sandboxed programs that run in a [permissions-based](/metamask-snaps/how-do-snap-permissions-work) system. Snaps do not have access to any data from the MetaMask Extension or from other Snaps unless they have permission to do so.

14. **Are Snaps available for all networks that MetaMask supports?** Certain Snaps work with the networks that MetaMask supports or work independently of any network. Individual Snaps can decide which network(s) they work with. Also, some Snaps even add new networks to MetaMask, such as [Interoperability Snaps](/metamask-snaps/what-are-interoperability-snaps).

15. **My question was not answered or I 'm experiencing issues with MetaMask Snaps. What should I do?** If you are encountering an issue with a specific Snap, consider reaching out directly to the developers of that Snap. [Read more about troubleshooting a Snap](/metamask-snaps/how-to-troubleshoot-snap-issues). If you still encounter issues with MetaMask Snaps, get in touch with Support via the “Start a Conversation” button on our [homepage](http://support.metamask.io?utm_source=metamaskSupport&utm_medium=knowledge-base&utm_campaign=2023_Sep_snaps-launch_content_faq).

16. **Is the MetaMask Snaps Directory essentially the same as a web2 environment where people can install applications and plug-ins?** No, the MetaMask Snaps Directory is different in that Snaps can be installed from anywhere, and access to them is not limited to one/our own directory. For example, Snaps can be installed from third-party directories or directly from a dapp itself. We expect to see this community-built ecosystem grow over time. It's important to acknowledge one limitation of the current Snaps Open Beta system: at the time of launch (Sep 2023), it cannot be fully permissionlessly extended. The Snaps that can be installed are ones that we approved because we confirmed they were audited, in addition to being confined in all the ways the installation prompt says. This was made both out of an abundance of caution, and because we have ideas for how to add additional safety for a permissionless version that will take longer to implement, but are currently working on.
