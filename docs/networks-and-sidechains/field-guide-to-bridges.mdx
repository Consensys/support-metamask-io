:::warning[Potential Loss of Assets]

Transferring assets between blockchains is not necessarily a simple task. Some tokens cannot be sent from one network to another — and if you do, **you can lose them forever**.

## What is a bridge?

A bridge is an app that allows you to transfer assets (cryptocurrencies, NFTs, or other tokens) between one blockchain and another. For example, transferring from BSC (now BNB Chain) to Ethereum.

## Why do I need to use a bridge?

- Many users use the same address on multiple blockchains, for example by [adding a blockchain connection](/networks-and-sidechains/managing-networks/how-to-add-a-custom-network-rpc) in MetaMask. What if they've got an NFT on Gnosis Chain, but they want to have it on Polygon?
- Conversely, you might have a different address, say on BSC, than what you use on Ethereum. You may think that you can just send tokens from your BSC address directly to your Ethereum address; after all, they're both EVM-compatible, right?

_Wrong._ **The BSC blockchain and Ethereum blockchains are separate networks, with no built-in knowledge of each other.**

If you send to your Ethereum address from BSC, BSC will send to the address you put in, but _on the BSC network._ For more information on this specific scenario, [see here](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/how-to-recover-crypto-transferred-to-the-wrong-network-on-binance).

## What bridge should I use?

:::info[MetaMask Bridge]

You can now access a curated, straightforward bridging experience in MetaMask Bridge, available at [portfolio.metamask.io](https://portfolio.metamask.io/), or by clicking the 'Bridge' button in MetaMask Extension. Only certain tokens and network combinations are available initially.

:::

You should choose a bridge primarily based on what you're trying to move, where. For example, some bridges only move ERC-20 (currency) tokens; others specifically handle ERC-721 and 1155 (NFTs). The last thing you want to do is try to transfer tokens to a different network, and never receive them.

### There is no definitive listing of bridges.

This is Web3, which is based around permissionless, open development; this means that at any given time, there might be a new bridge between networks. There are also **bridge aggregators**, which are platforms that allow you to use several bridges in conjunction, conveniently transferring assets across platforms.

:::info

Network Profiles For detailed information regarding a specific network, see our [Network Profiles](/network-profiles/), which include bridge information for each network.

_The following is a non-exhaustive list of bridges and aggregators, in no particular order. MetaMask does not recommend or endorse any of these products; we are providing this information as a starting point for you to do your own research and understand how each bridge works before using it._

## How does a bridge work?

There are a number of different mechanisms that bridges use to move assets between networks; often, they are centralized entities that operate almost like an exchange. Others are more decentralized. If you're interested in the nuts and bolts, start with ethereum.org's [documentation here](https://ethereum.org/en/bridges/).

## I need step-by-step instructions on how to use a bridge

Given the above-mentioned wide variety in bridge platforms, networks, and functionality, we can't provide a step-by-step that will work for _every_ bridge. In general, though, this is how it works:

- Navigate to the bridge that you have identified will work for your particular combination of networks and token types
- Log in to the app with your MetaMask wallet
- Choose the network you're going _from_ and _to_
- Choose the asset you want to transfer
  - During these steps, you may need to sign approvals in your MetaMask Wallet. _Make sure you read every transaction or approval you make carefully._ For more on approvals, [see here](https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/the-seal-of-approval-know-what-youre-consenting-to-with-permissions-and-approvals-in-metamask/) or [here](/transactions-and-gas/transactions/what-is-a-token-approval).
- Initiate the bridging process
- WAIT
  - Bridging generally is not instantaneous, and can often take five to ten minutes for the transaction to be fully processed on the first chain, and then the second chain.
- Open your wallet on the second chain (If you're managing both chain's assets in MetaMask, make sure you switch networks in MetaMask!) and verify the assets are present; remember, you may need to [add the tokens to be able to see them](/managing-my-tokens/custom-tokens/how-to-display-tokens-in-metamask).
