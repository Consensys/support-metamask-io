#### _Note: This article describes the process for moving assets you hold in MetaMask to the Binance centralized exchange (CEX). This is not the same thing as [moving assets from MetaMask to the Binance Smart Chain.](/networks-and-sidechains/binance/sending-assets-to-binance-bnb-smart-chain)_

If you are trying to transfer assets to Binance from MetaMask, please make sure you are following the guidelines to avoid a loss.

First of all, you have to understand that Binance is a centralized exchange that functions on a limited number of networks. **(Ethereum mainnet, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, etc.)** So please make sure you're certain of:

- The network your tokens are currently on (the one you're sending from)
- Support for that network on the Binance exchange.

:::danger

#### Warning

If you've already sent the tokens and Binance does not support the network, your funds are most likely gone for good. For further information, please contact Binance at [https://www.binance.com/en/support](https://www.binance.com/en/support)**.**

:::

After making sure that Binance supports the network, you will need to make sure that you have funds in MetaMask for gas fees _on that network_.

Please note that gas fees are paid in the native token of the network, for example:

- ETH for Ethereum Mainnet
- BNB for Binance Smart Chain
- MATIC for Polygon.

If you don't have tokens for the gas fees, you won't be able to send the assets to the Binance exchange.

Follow [Binance's instructions here](https://support.binance.us/hc/en-us/articles/360046787054-How-to-Deposit-Crypto) (for the US exchange) [or here](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/115003764971) (for outside the US) to obtain the specific address for the token you're depositing within your Binance account. Copy this address and paste it into MetaMask [when you are asked for the destination address.](/managing-my-tokens/moving-your-tokens/how-to-send-tokens-from-your-metamask-wallet)
