#### NFTs in MetaMask Portfolio

Have you heard about MetaMask Portfolio? It displays all your NFTs in a consolidated portfolio view, and may mean you don't need to add them to MetaMask at all.

Give it a try at [portfolio.metamask.io](https://portfolio.metamask.io/) or click the link from MetaMask Extension.

:::

**ERC-1155 tokens are supported by MetaMask Mobile and Extension**, meaning your wallet can receive, store, and display assets aligned with this token standard.

**MetaMask does not yet support sending your ERC-1155 tokens**, although we're working to implement this feature soon. In the meantime, we recommend you use a platform that supports ERC-1155 transfers, such as OpenSea.
