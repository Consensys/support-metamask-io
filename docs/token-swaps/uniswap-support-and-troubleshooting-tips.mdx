### Please note that [MetaMask is a self-custodial wallet](/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet). That means that we do not have any control over your funds, and we do not keep your personal information or account access. That also means that, while we enable interactions with third parties like Uniswap, we are not responsible for what happens on Uniswap.

Answers to the most common Uniswap issues can be found on their [FAQ site](https://uniswap.org/faq).

Some additional tips:

- Make sure you have enough ETH for the gas fee in order to complete the swap.

- Make sure you both APPROVE and then SWAP (two transactions). If you only approved, it will not be completed.

- After the swap completes,** if you do not see the tokens you swapped for**, you may need to simply [add the token(s) to your MetaMask in order to see them.](/managing-my-tokens/custom-tokens/how-to-display-tokens-in-metamask)

- If you are getting failed transactions, make sure the gwei is set high enough, and the gas limit is above 250,000.

- If your MetaMask activity feed is inaccurate or stuck, meaning you are unable to speed up, cancel or send new transactions, try [these instructions](/transactions-and-gas/transactions/how-to-speed-up-or-cancel-a-pending-transaction).

- Never give your Secret Recovery Phrase to anyone or any site. If Uniswap asks you for this information, then you are not on Uniswap, you are on a scam site or app.

**If you are still having trouble with Uniswap, we highly encourage you to reach out to them via their [support channels](https://support.uniswap.org/hc/en-us).**
