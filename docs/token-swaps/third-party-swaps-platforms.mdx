While MetaMask has [its own built-in Swaps tool](/token-swaps/user-guide-swaps), there's a whole ecosystem out there of third-party token swapping platforms. This article aims to point out some frequent issues that users have when swapping tokens, and serve as a **non-definitive** directory to third-party swap platform support services. _MetaMask is not affiliated with any of these organizations._

#### Keep in mind that some popular exchanges are not companies in the traditional sense, and may not offer official customer support. **Exercise extreme caution** if you are engaging with a product through a channel such as Discord or Twitter.

#### **Most importantly: NEVER GIVE ANYONE YOUR [SECRET RECOVERY PHRASE](/privacy-and-security/what-is-a-secret-recovery-phrase-and-how-to-keep-your-crypto-wallet-secure).**

## DEXs vs CEXs

Decentralized Exchanges, or DEXs, are closer to something like a public service than a business. The question of "how decentralized" they are is a subject of debate, but the core reality is: a DEX is an open software project, whose code lives "in the open" on the blockchain, and with which users can interact in a dependable way, based on how the protocol is programmed. Examples of DEXs include Uniswap, Quickswap and SushiSwap, amongst many, many others.

A Centralized Exchange, on the other hand, is something more akin to an investment bank. A CEX often serves as a "fiat onramp/offramp", integrating with a nationally-issued fiat currency, and allowing users to interact with cryptocurrencies in a more traditional, bank-like environment. CEXs often report users' account and balance information to tax authorities, whereas while interacting with a DEX, this may be left to the responsibility of the user; for more information on tax responsibility, [see here](/managing-my-wallet/tax-compliance-and-crypto-assets).

## Price Impact

## Impermanent Loss

Impermanent loss is another commonly-experienced phenomenon, especially when participating in liquidity pools.
