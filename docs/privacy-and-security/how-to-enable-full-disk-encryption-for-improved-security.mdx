To keep your computer and its contents as safe as possible from someone with physical access to your machine, we recommend you enable full disk encryption on your computer.

- On a Mac this is the [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837) feature.
- On Windows, you should enable [BitLocker](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-on-device-encryption-0c453637-bc88-5f74-5105-741561aae838).
- On Linux, you can use [LUKS](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/disk-encryption-luks) for this safety.

With full disk encryption, an attacker with physical access to your computer should not be able to extract any of its contents, including any private keys you have stored throughout your disk, but also site passwords, banking details, and other sensitive information.
