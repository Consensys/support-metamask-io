The crypto community is growing all over the world. We believe that if we want to accelerate global adoption and if this technology is to become mainstream, we need to also engage with traditional financial actors and educate them on how this would revolutionize everything we know — without compromising on the fundamentals of our beliefs such as decentralization and a more inclusive world.

In line with this philosophy, did we raise funds from JP Morgan in 2021? Yes. Do they influence our decision making? Absolutely not. Nor did JP Morgan participate in our most recent Series D round. Moreover, their shares have been diluted and they own less than 10% of Consensys. Any of our competitors claiming that JP Morgan “owns us” are absolutely wrong, and we invite them to fact-check before confusing the community with inaccurate information.

Our latest fundraising round includes ParaFi Capital, Temasek, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Microsoft, Anthos Capital, Sound Ventures, C Ventures, Series C investors, Third Point, Marshall Wace, True Capital Management, UTA VC, and United Talent Agency's venture fund.

Consensys employees are also key drivers of our growth. Any employee at Consensys receives equity and is part of this project.
