**DO NOT share your Secret Recovery Phrase with anyone! These words can be used to steal from all your accounts. You can't edit or change your Secret Recovery Phrase.**

1. It's possible that one or more words you've written down is misspelled, or you mistook it for a similar word. To confirm the spelling, and to make sure the word is on the list of possible options for a Secret Recovery Phrase, you can check against the BIP-39 list: [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt)
   - _Tip: Use the browser's search function (Cmd+F on Mac and Ctrl+F on Windows) to look for each word that you have written down, so you can check the spelling in your backup. If you can't find it, try the closest word._
2. Make sure your Secret Recovery Phrase is written in the exact **same order** it was provided, with **one space between each word**, and in **lower case**.
