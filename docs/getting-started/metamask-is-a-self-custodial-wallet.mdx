#### New to crypto and web3?

Head to [MetaMask Learn](https://learn.metamask.io/) for a straightforward learning experience designed specifically for newcomers to web3. It's completely free, available in multiple languages, and includes useful tools such as simulations to help you find your feet with MetaMask.

:::

MetaMask includes a **self-custodial** (also commonly referred to as non-custodial) cryptocurrency and token wallet. It gives _you_ complete control of your access keys and therefore your assets.

'Self-custodial' refers to the fact that it's _you_ ('self') who holds your wallet's private key(s). A self-custodial wallet eliminates the third party between you and your crypto-assets, which is more suitable for some people.

**MetaMask doesn't store any data about the wallet**. Everything you see is in your browser or your mobile app at a local level. **There are no email addresses associated with accounts**. There is only a Secret Recovery Phrase (seed phrase) that is given once and cannot be changed or reset. Also, if you have imported other accounts using their private keys, their Secret Recovery Phrases should also never be shared. Please store your Secret Recovery Phrase and private keys offline and back them up.

For more detail on this topic, see our [blog post here](https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/whats-in-a-self-custody-non-custodial-wallet-anyway/).

:::info[MetaMask and email addresses]

You open and use your MetaMask wallet without ever inputting your email. This privacy is part of MetaMask's identity. However, **we may have your email address if you have used our Support services**, as we it need to track your issue and follow up with you. This doesn't apply for conversations that you begin using the'start a Conversation' button. We may also have your email if you've signed up for the MetaMask newsletter or if you opted into notifications from our Community page. See [here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12683145255835) for more information about official emails.

You should be highly sceptical of any emails you receive claiming to be from us. If you have never had help from Support, the email will be a phishing scam; even if it is from us, we will **never** ask for your Secret Recovery Phrase (seed phrase).

:::

Because of MetaMask's self-custodial design, **we cannot access your wallet from our side.** **You are the only person who can access it directly from the Extension or Mobile app. **
