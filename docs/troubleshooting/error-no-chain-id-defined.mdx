If you are using the Ethereum Mainnet, try toggling networks: switch from Ethereum mainnet to another network, and then back again.

Please make sure you are also on the latest version of MetaMask.

If you manually added the network to MetaMask, head to Settings > Networks and make sure the chain ID associated with the network is the correct one. To find a chain ID, you could head to [Chainlist](/networks-and-sidechains/managing-networks/add-a-network-using-chainlist), which maintains a catalogue of EVM-compatible networks and their details, or search for the relevant documentation of the network itself.
