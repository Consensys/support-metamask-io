Depending on your browser performance, there might be a little lag when writing the MetaMask password characters and you might get the error: "invalid password".

Before contacting MetaMask Support, please try the following:

1. Type your password slowly, one character at a time, making sure that the key you press is reflected in the password characters. Then pause for a second when complete, and try submitting.
2. If that doesn't work, try to write your password into a .txt file, and then copy and paste it into the MetaMask login prompt.
