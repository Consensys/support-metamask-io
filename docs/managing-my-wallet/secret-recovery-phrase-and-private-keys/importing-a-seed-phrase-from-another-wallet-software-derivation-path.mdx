When importing a Secret Recovery Phrase (seed phrase), **MetaMask only supports the default BIP-44 derivation path (m/44'/60'/0'/0)**. For more information, see the technical specification [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki).

Currently, you can only use Ledger's derivation paths when connecting a Ledger hardware wallet (you get options for Legacy derivation MEW/MyCrypto, Ledger Live, or BIP44). The MetaMask team is looking at adding more options and customization; for example, custom networks may use different derivation paths.

At this time, Trezor hardware wallet integration only supports the BIP44 derivation path.
