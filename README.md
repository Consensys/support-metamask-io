## How to contribute

See something missing? Is there an error in an article, a broken link? Is something really frustrating about the site? We love this feedback! 

To report something, create an issue [here](https://github.com/Consensys/support-metamask-io/issues).

### How to submit a suggestion or change

The best way to suggest a change to these docs is through a process known as a **pull request**. If you're not familiar with how that works, check out [GitHub's guide here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

If that process is too involved for you, you can always open a thread on the [MetaMask Community page](https://community.metamask.io).
